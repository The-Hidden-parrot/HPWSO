this list is for version information, extra comments, server support, and version patchnotes

server support: Currently there is no server support provided by myself, while this project is server-side javascript, I do not currently have
a way to host HPWS servers for the general public. in addition to this simple reality the fact that, because this is so early in development,
it is almost pointless to host WSO & HPB because there is little to no functionality givin by doing that, so I have decided to make this git so 
others can modify my code for their own uses.

current supported version: none
